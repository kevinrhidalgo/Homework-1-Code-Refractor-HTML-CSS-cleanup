# Homework.1-Code-Refractor
A Refactor webpage to make the website more accessible and cleaner.
# Code Refactor Assignment

This is an exercise in refactoring an existing codebase that is given. There is no need to add code but rather organize and cleaning up while also cutting up some.

Websites such as thses need have to consider how the consumer might visit. The purpose is to always strive to be accessible for all those who visit.

Purpose of this was to get me to modify the code in a way that it does not change the display for the user but rather for the developer with it still containing the semantic tags necessary to convey the structure.

I did this by changing or adding html tags, inserting attributes, and updating the CSS while also fixing a few bugs.
